## ❓ Why did I build this?

I created this project because I wanted to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and gain hands-on experience using it in a real-world React application. Additionally, as I was nearing graduation, I found my own degree planner confusing and difficult to navigate. It was challenging to figure out which courses I still needed to take, what options were available, and how to efficiently plan my remaining semesters. This tool was built to solve those problems for myself and to help others in a similar situation.
